Paper link: [Multiscale Generative Adversarial Network Based on Wavelet Feature Learning for SAR-to-Optical Image Translation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9912365)

This repository provides:

1. the official code implementation of WFLM-GAN.
2. the SEN-12 dataset used in our research. 

- Use `train.py` to start training. 

- The WFLM-GAN model is located in the `models/wflm_gan_model.py`.
